# P9 – Inability of Users to Access and Modify Data

## Summary

Users cannot exercise data access, portability, or correction rights. GDPR and other laws require supporting these rights.

## Prevention

Provide self-service or process for access, export (portability), and correction. Respond within required timelines; authenticate the requester; document process.

## Testing

Exercise access, export, and correction flows; verify response time and completeness; test authentication of requester.
