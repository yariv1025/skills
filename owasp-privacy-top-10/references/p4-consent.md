# P4 – Consent on Everything

## Summary

Lack of proper consent mechanisms. Consent must be informed, specific, and revocable for processing that requires it.

## Prevention

Obtain explicit consent where required; document what was consented to and when. Support withdrawal of consent; avoid pre-ticked or bundled consent; use clear language.

## Testing

Verify consent flow and documentation; test withdrawal; check for dark patterns.
