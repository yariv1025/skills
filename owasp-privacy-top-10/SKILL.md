# OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks

This skill encodes the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks for privacy-aware design and review. References are loaded per risk. Based on OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks v2.0 2021.

## When to Read Which Reference

| Risk | Read |
|------|------|
| P1 Web Application Vulnerabilities | [references/p1-web-app-vulnerabilities.md](references/p1-web-app-vulnerabilities.md) |
| P2 Operator-sided Data Leakage | [references/p2-operator-data-leakage.md](references/p2-operator-data-leakage.md) |
| P3 Insufficient Data Breach Response | [references/p3-breach-response.md](references/p3-breach-response.md) |
| P4 Consent on Everything | [references/p4-consent.md](references/p4-consent.md) |
| P5 Non-transparent Policies | [references/p5-non-transparent-policies.md](references/p5-non-transparent-policies.md) |
| P6 Insufficient Deletion of User Data | [references/p6-insufficient-deletion.md](references/p6-insufficient-deletion.md) |
| P7 Insufficient Data Quality | [references/p7-data-quality.md](references/p7-data-quality.md) |
| P8 Missing or Insufficient Session Expiration | [references/p8-session-expiration.md](references/p8-session-expiration.md) |
| P9 Inability to Access and Modify Data | [references/p9-user-access-modify-data.md](references/p9-user-access-modify-data.md) |
| P10 Excessive Data Collection | [references/p10-excessive-collection.md](references/p10-excessive-collection.md) |

## Quick Patterns

- Fix technical vulnerabilities that affect data; prevent operator leakage; have a breach response plan. Obtain valid consent; be transparent; support deletion, access, and portability; minimize collection; expire sessions.

## Workflow

Load the reference for the risk you are addressing. See [OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-privacy-risks) for the official list.
