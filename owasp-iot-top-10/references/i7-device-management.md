# I7 – Absence of Device Management

## Summary

Inability to manage devices (updates, decommissioning, incident response). Increases risk and operational burden.

## Prevention

- Support secure provisioning, update, and decommissioning. Enable remote lock/wipe where appropriate; log security events; support inventory and response.

## Testing

- Verify update and decommission flows; test remote management capabilities.
