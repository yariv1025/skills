# I6 – Insecure Data Transfer and Storage

## Summary

Data sent or stored without encryption. Interception or device access exposes sensitive data.

## Prevention

- Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS) and at rest. Use strong keys and key management; protect backups and logs.

## Testing

- Verify encryption in transit and at rest; check for cleartext sensitive data.
