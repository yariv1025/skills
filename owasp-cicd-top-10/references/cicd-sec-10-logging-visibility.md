# CICD-SEC-10 – Insufficient Logging and Visibility

## Summary

Missing or inadequate logging and monitoring of pipeline activity. Hard to detect abuse, credential theft, or supply chain attacks.

## Prevention

- Log pipeline runs, changes, and access; retain and protect logs. Alert on sensitive events (e.g. secret access, production deploy); integrate with SIEM; audit regularly.

## Testing

- Verify log content and retention; test alerting; review access to logs.
