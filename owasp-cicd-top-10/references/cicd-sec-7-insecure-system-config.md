# CICD-SEC-7 – Insecure System Configuration

## Summary

Runners, services, and CI/CD components with weak or default config. Unpatched or misconfigured systems are easily compromised.

## Prevention

- Harden runners and services; patch promptly; disable unnecessary features. Use dedicated/ephemeral runners; restrict network and permissions; follow hardening guides.

## Testing

- Scan runners and services for weak config; verify patching and network restrictions.
