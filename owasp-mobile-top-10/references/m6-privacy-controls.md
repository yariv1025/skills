# M6 – Inadequate Privacy Controls

## Summary

User data collected, stored, or shared without proper consent, minimization, or protection. Privacy regulations and user trust require explicit controls.

## Prevention

- Collect only what is necessary; obtain clear consent; document data use.
- Apply access controls and encryption to PII; support data deletion and portability.
- Minimize data in logs and third-party SDKs; review permissions and disclosures.

## Testing

- Audit data flows and storage; verify consent and deletion; check privacy policy alignment.
