# LLM03 – Training Data & Supply Chain

## Summary

Risks from training data quality and supply chain (data sources, model provenance, dependencies). Malicious or biased data affects model behavior.

## Prevention

- Curate and verify training data sources; maintain provenance; scan for poisoning and bias. Secure model pipeline and dependencies; verify integrity of models and datasets.

## Testing

- Audit data sources and pipeline; test for unintended behavior from data; verify supply chain integrity.
